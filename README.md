# Tesseract

This site shows a tesseract (4-dimentionsal cube), being rotated through the fourth dimension. The result is projected onto three dimensions, and that can be viewed in one of four ways:

1. Two-dimensional projection of the three-dimentionsl proojection
2. Two images, one for each eye.
3. Same as 2, but encoded for Vision Pro.
4. Random dot stereogram.

I've done the 3-d to 2-d projection before, on the Lisp Machine, at the Atari Cambridge Research Lab, in 1984, but it will be nice to do it all in Elm. And upload libraries to do the math.
